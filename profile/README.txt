First of all, thank you again for inviting me to interview and thank you for sending over the task, I enjoyed working on it. 

My design process when approaching this task was slightly quicker than usual - I drew a very quick wireframe by hand to sketch the layout (I've attached a photo to show how simple it was - wireframe.jpg) and then used your guideline screenshot for reference on style. 

I've aimed to show an example of my usual CSS architecture for most projects, with individual SCSS files at component level, these are then compiled into a global stylesheet. I normally take the same approach to JavaScript, however as I've only written one JavaScript function for this project it didn't seem neccesary at this stage. 

I used 'vanilla' JS for the purpose of this project. I would usually utilise jQuery for simple DOM manipulation tasks on a page like this, to take advantage of browser support in client projects, however I know you support latest Chrome and Safari only so this wasn't needed. I've produced a static HTML page on this occassion, but once the view is bound to a data model, a framework such as KO, Angular or Vue.js would be useful for displaying data in repeating UI elements. 

I've designed 'desktop-first' to reflect your core audience, as discussed in the interview, but I've ensured the design is functional on smaller devices. 

From a design point of view, I tried to focus on a stats area within the profile, including 6 "highlight" stats featuring key information, these stats could change to be relevant to player's position, and could be improved with icons and graphical representation where required (a diagram of a goal showing where goals were scored, for instance). 

Kind regards,
Nick
